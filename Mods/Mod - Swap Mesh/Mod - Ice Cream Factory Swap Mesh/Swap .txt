thne test swapping ice door with another  door

---- Aim: ----
* Make the unused garage at the ice cream factory useable, either;-
a) as a real garage
b) as a pay n spray
c) a walk-through wall that, at least provides cover.

the only possible one i know of if the 3rd (c)
- i have swapped a pay n spray door with a wall before, and you can drive through it.

so far my tests have failed.

i am not googling what ipl and ide are - it is most likely completely shit info on it.

some definition files from 3dsmax probably, dunno, i started 3ds in 2010
