The exampel that occured is at ocean hieghts garage, when a wall appeared after modfifyign addrress.

i basically went up the stack from trying to find the "pizza's delivered" address, to set that value
and not far up this mesh swap happened when copy - pasting values.

Unfortunately, as usual, i did not save the address, becuas ei did not notice the change until some time after.

find that memeory region
set to 4 bytes long so its all just 8 didgits on 1 line
and samsh valeus in everythign up the stack until soemthign happens.

documenting that would be an amazing discovery.


AS FOR THE FILES IN THIS FODLER: 

these are examples of doing a mesh swa using the gaame data files. but after discovvering that addres thing i did not look into much more.


THE PURPOSE:

WAs to sawp garage doors for walls you can drive through.
Which woudl fix issue swith getting vehicles into garages when they get despawned, especially if your glithcign expldoing vehicles.
