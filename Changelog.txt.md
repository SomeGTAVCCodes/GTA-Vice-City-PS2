
* clean up all folders: removed OLD etc
* Garage Editor - codes for the Helipads: change VHs
				- several mission & cutscene VH's HEX added to the garage editor list.
* Starter Save - discovered a way to get the End-Game "lousy" T-Shirt to the player at the start of the game.

- As usual, all stuff needs re-checking.
-helipad spawning is a bit difficult to test, i cannot find the address that forces the spawn, so you have to run around and go back to make stuff spawn in to check if your at the correct helipad after modifyin g which vehicel spawns there.

I put the "Hunter" at Hyman Condo. maybe other people can do the other helipads.
vcpolmav is easy to find, the other helipads not done.

Also be warned, the helipaads are like garages, once you change the spawning VH ID, it is basked into your save file.
