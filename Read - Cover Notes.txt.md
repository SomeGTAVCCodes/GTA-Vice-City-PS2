---- Differences ----
* There is 40GB of Vice City DVD's (regions, versions, re-releases) & 30GB of this is redundant, duplicated (identical) data.
* I created a folder of just the differences between versions & regions to save space. The result is approximately 4.5GB instead of 40GB+, i strongly recommend doing the same.
