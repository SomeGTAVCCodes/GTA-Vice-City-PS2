other than the one time warnign message when saving. 
The exception - or rather - reason the message appears is most likely in the event the player uses a cheat which is irreversible. 

anyway, if you want to bring the one time message back i have included an image of a hex edit example

I am not sure if any other data in the save file pertains to what i call the "cheat status" other flags and such, peopel who mod pc versions will know..

do the hex edit on a save game that has saved using cheats. load the game, try to save it and the message will pop up again, thus confirming the status was removed.
