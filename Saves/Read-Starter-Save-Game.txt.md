//* I added an updated Starter Save file that includes Jump Boost Taxis.
//* The next release will have more customised stuff; a hunter on hyman condo roof, instead of maverick, and diaz mansion having a tank instead of the Stretch limo.

[How to Replicate Perfect Starter Save: If you want to speed run a start save game creation(?)]
//* Creating the perfect Starter-Save-Game can be a long process
1. Boot up your modified GTA-VC iso on PCSX2 
* (See mods section)
2. Use Cheat Engine (.ct) or PCSX2 cheats (.pnach) to
	a) Set Hidden Packages Found to 100 (Gives 150 Health & Armour, but not 200)
	b) Give Mega Cash - Â£10,000,000+
	c) Set 100% Completion with NO "total liar" status
	d) Set Criminal Rating to GodFather
	e) spawn a custom vehicle in you garage for side quests (see Garage Editor section).
	f) reset stats when complete.
3. Manually Collect/ Purchase a Weapon Set, do not use cheats!
	Note: 	Using cheats will give the cheater status - It may be possible to remove cheater status by modifying the save file with a hex editor, or using cheat engine (it works im sure). Some documented info is included in this pack.
	a) i recommend activating Vigilante missions outside the hotel, this will access to upstairs without triggering 1st mission.
4. purchase ocean beach to use the garage editor to have any vehicle.
5. do ambulance, firetruck. Optional: police, taxi missions (use garage editor to spawn custom vehicels, damage proof etc).
6. Save the game with infinite sprint, fireproof, mega cash, weapons purchased, damage proof vehicles & all cool stuff etc.
7. Save again using a clean original dvd - not modded & reset stats etc.
8. Put save file on PS2, PS3, PS4, PC and enjoy!

** Optional: Accessing The other Islands -> get the fire truck -> get Fire Proof!, complete bloodring challenges, etc.
	* Modify the Disc contents "object.dat" file and re-build iso with imgburn using default settings.
	a) object.dat -> search for "nt | ntbarrrier" & replace values with e.g. the lamppost values.
	b) travel to the barrier and drive straight through it, obtain the fire truck -> return to 1st island save point and do the fire missions there, it is the easiest point
