[Starter Save] [PAL 2003 2.03]
* Whilst there are many NTSC 100% (or part complete) saves online, this is the only useful PAL Starter Save i have seen

* Save game 	- Start 1st save at hotel, admiral & faggio at ocean beach, both damage proof.
* Save State 	- Start at normal starting spot, with admiral and faggi damage proof in ocean beach.

* 0% complete, ...but with all the benefits of 100% completion
* 1st save point (start position, hotel , or ocean beach)
* Mega Cash
* 150 Health & Armour
* Weapons
* Infinite Sprint
* Infinite Ammo
* Fireproof!!
* better driving, more powerful etc
* No "Cheater Status" present in save file. (No "Cheats Used" Save-Game Warning).
* Special Vehicles in garage
* admiral and faggio in ocean beach garage, both damage proof cutscene vehicles.
* ocean beach purchased simply for the garage editor/ and cutscene vehicels.
* No Storm Warning Barriers mod baked into save file - free roam like a pro.
* GodFather Criminal Rating
* DTS enabled by default for PS2 & PS3 users. 
* stats at 0, which is actually less than a start save.

designed for PS2/ PS3 users, good for PC emulator users too.


[Starter Save States]
* I have included a save state, but it is unlikely it will work..let me know on a random youtube video if it does.
* i used to have saves from various points in the game (many years ago), that stuff helps alot when making codes.

Save files containing vehicles would be most useful for obtaining the vehicle hex data on weird glitched vehicles and colours.
