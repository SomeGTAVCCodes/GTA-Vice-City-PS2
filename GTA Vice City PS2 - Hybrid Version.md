This information can be used to create your own GTAVC version.
The best content from 10+ Console releases reducing total file size from 40GB of .iso versions. to 3GB 1 Hybrid Version & approx 5GB Of differences to recreate other versions/regions - no loss of data.
Originally intended on patch files (120+) to create a version & region conversion kit, but then there are files that exist in some versions and not another within the system folder, and i would not be allowed.

So this just instructions users will have to perform themselves, if they are the type of people who have multiple or every version of gtavc ps2/psn then this will save them alot of space.

Using 2003 PAL is the best option, or NTSC 2003.
 
It is more up to date that NTSC 2003 - although i have no idea if that makes any difference, none of the 2002 bugs, retains the original dialogue/ story unlike 2004's edits.
* add NTSC hz to it to make it as good as NTSC, (PAL actually ends up running slighty higher at 60+), and it actually makes a big difference to driving etc.
* add the 2004 load screens for better quality, which i think also fixes a resolution bug switchy
* add the 2004 peds file.
* set occlusions to 0 if using emulator.
* modify other game data files as required, barrier remvoal, weapons damage set to sensible values etc.
* create differences folders from each version by comparing them. It should be about 5GB of files, all other content is entirely the same on every version.
* create you r modded iso, which can be the full size for Console use or if using emulator you can also remvoe the duplciate .img files.

So the result is your modded iso, your differences folders, and you Console .pkg file.
Less than 15GB instead of 44GB+, no loss of data.
