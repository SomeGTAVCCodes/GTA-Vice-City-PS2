
This information can be used to create your own GTAVC version, the best content from 10+ Console releases
reducing the file size from 40GB of .iso versions. to 3GB 1 Hybrid Version & approx 5GB Of differences to recreate other versions/regions - no loss of data.
Originally intended on patch files (120+) to create a version & region conversion kit, but then there are files that exist in some versions and not another within the system folder, and i am not sure if that would be allowed
So this just instructions users will ahev to perform themselves, if they are the type of people who have multiple or every version of gtavc ps2/psn.

Using 2003 PAL is the best option.
 
It is more up to date that NTSC 2003, none of the 2002 bugs, retains the original dialogue/ story unlike 2004's edits.
* add NTSC hz to it to make it as good as NTSC, (PAL actually ends up running slighty higher at 60+), and it actually makes a big difference to driving etc.
* add the 2004 load screens for better quality, which i think also fixes a resolution bug switchy
* add the 2004 peds file.
* set occlusions to 0 if using emulator.
* modify other game data files as required, barrier remvoal, weapons damage set to sensible values etc.
