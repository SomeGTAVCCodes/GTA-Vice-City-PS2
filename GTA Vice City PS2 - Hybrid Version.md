
This information can be used to create your own GTAVC version, taken the best of content from the 10+ Console releases
reducing the totla file size from over 40GB of .iso versions. to 4.5GB 1 Hybrid Version & approx 5GB Of differences.
Originally intended on createing patch files (120+) to create a version & region conversion kit, but then there are files that exist in some versions and not another within the system folder, and i am not sure if that would be allowed
The patches can be used to convert the folowwing
main.scm files
txd files 
etc
basically everythign escept anythign that does not exist between veersions. 
I have considered uplaoding a correct PS2 collection, without the 10+ pointles siso files, but then i also need to solve the adiditonal depency on the duplicated img files to truly make the hybrid perfect.
