[How to Replicate Perfect Starter Save: If you want to speed run a start save game creation(?)]
//* Creating the perfect Starter-Save-Game can be a long process, i made several attempts & had save state corruptions, ambulance mission fails, random police encounters etc.

1. Boot up a modified GTA-VC DVD on PCSX2
	-  modify the "object.dat" and "handling.cfg" (See mods section)
2. Use Cheat Engine to
	a) Set Hidden Packages Found to 100 (Gives 150 Health & Armour)
	b) Give Mega Cash - Â£10,000,000+
	c) Set 100% Completion with NO "total liar" status
	d) Criminal Rating to GodFather
	e) spawn a custom vehicle in you garage for side quests (the admiral from the cutscene and the faggio) - see Garage Editor section..
	f) reset stats when complete.
3. Manually Collect/ Purchase a Weapon Set, do not use cheats!
	Note: 	Using cheats will give the cheater status - It may be possible to remove cheater status by modifying the save file with a hex editor, or using cheat engine (it works im sure). Some documented info is included in this pack.
	a) i recommend activating Vigilante missions outside the hotel, this will access to upsatirs without triggering 1st mission.
4. purchase ocean beach to use the garage editor to have any vehicle.
5. do ambulance, firetruck. Optional: police, taxi missions (use garage editor to spawn custom ones).
5. Save the game with infinite sprint, fireproof, mega cash, weapons purchased, damage roof vehicles and all cool stuff etc.
** Optional: Accessing The other Islands -> get the fire truck -> get Fire Proof!
	* Modify the Disc contents "object.dat" file and re-build iso with imgburn using default settings.
	a) object.dat -> search for "nt | ntbarrrier" & replace values with e.g. the lamppost values.
	b) travel to the barrier and drive straight through it, obtain the fire truck -> return to 1st island save point and do the fire missions there, it is the easiest point
Note: * Modify "Handling.cfg" file to make the Fire-truck & Ambulance Invincible with better handling.
8. save again using a clean original dvd - not modded and if you did do not do so already: reset the stats etc.
