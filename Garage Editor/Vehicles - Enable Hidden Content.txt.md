
[COUGAR MOD]
According to "Site: TCRF" some vehicles have either models or textures - as usual extreme lack of info and no explanation on how to replciate.
Anywaay,

[Instructions]
* Modify the "default.ide" to enable the extra content
* a patch code may be required to display the name, if it exists in the code i tried coug, cougr, couga etc... 
* The 3D Model is confirmed working as long as you use the mapped texture too.
