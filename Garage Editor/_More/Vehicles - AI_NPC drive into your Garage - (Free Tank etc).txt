
5th time this has happened

If you do a mission where NPC/ AI chase you 
or interact with you

You can drive to Hyman Condo 

And 90% of the time (due to path nav issues) the vehicle will drive into your garage

On the Mission: Stick it to the man (biker gang mission)
* This happened with the Securicar

On other missions and roaming
* a firetruck
* the fbi 

the biker gang missions and the next biker mission here where the army chases you
