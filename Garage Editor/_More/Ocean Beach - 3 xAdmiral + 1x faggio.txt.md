// Not recommended
// to replicate park an admiral and faggio in garage. 
* use Cheat Engine to lock the addresses, open garage, then unlock the address.
// You will get cloned vehicles that may present some glitches, like texture or model variants. 
-when tested it gave 3 admirals and faggio, all 3 admirals were different grey shades and 1 had a missing license plate texture area around it.
