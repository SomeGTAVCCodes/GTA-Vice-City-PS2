discussion about special vehicles in this game! His guides include thorough 
and comprehensive coverage on all versions of the game for all platforms.

Of particular note are PC exclusives and the "On Mission = 0", or OM0 trick, 
which allows for several additional vehicles to be obtained that are otherwise 
unobtainable entirely, including an AP Maverick!

ABOUT
==============================================================================
This guide is to assist those players who enjoy collecting rare or unique 
vehicles. This guide lists all known proofed, special property, unique, and 
even rare vehicles (which often have to be unlocked). I'd say more, but I 
pretty much just summed it up.

This guide was written with the original version, NOT the Double Pack version, 
the Haitian-friendly version, the Xbox version, or the PC and Mobile versions. 
In these other versions, some vehicles may be different, and I will note any 
instances where possible. PC and Mobile also have many new tricks and 
strategies available due to features exclusive to those versions, however this 
guide will exclude all such information.

CAUTION! This guide may inadvertently contain spoilers! Although this guide 
does not intend to spoil anything, due to the nature of the guide, it may 
spoil names of people, places, or missions.

==============================================================================
*1* TERMS IN THE GUIDE
==============================================================================
This is a listing of all the special terms used in this guide.

BP - Bulletproof. Immune to all bullet damage. Bullet attacks include:  all 
 four classes of gun, sniper rifles, minigun, M60, and the Hunter's minigun. 
 NOTE: This proofing does NOT prevent the windshield from being shattered by 
 gunfire, nor does it stop gunfire from popping the tires.

FP - Fireproof. Immune to all incendiary weaponry, and to catching fire. 
 Molotovs cannot hurt this vehicle, and neither they, nor the flamethrower, 
 can set fire to it.

EP - Explosionproof. Immune to explosive damage. This includes grenades, 
 rocket launcher, exploding vehicles, Rhino shells, or Hunter missiles.

DP - Damageproof. Immune to physical damage. This includes punching the 
 vehicle, or using a melee weapon on it, as well as running into anything. 
 This also prevents the car from taking cosmetic damage, however, bumps and 
 scrapes CAN cause the doors to open (but they won't take damage). It is 
 worth noting that although motorcycles, boats, and helicopters CAN have this 
 property flagged on them, it will not produce any affect and they will 
 accumulate damage and be destroyed just like normal, even despite being DP.

AP - All-proof. This is BP/FP/EP/DP, all in one. The only ways to damage the 
 vehicle are flipping it over, getting hit by a Rhino, dunking it in the 
 water, or the Destroy All Cars cheat.

PPT - Pop-proof Tires. This vehicle's tires are immune to being popped by 
 spike strips. This is NOT included in the AP property, and also is not 
 preserved when storing vehicles in a garage.

Absolute limit (garages) - The maximum number of vehicles that can be stored 
 in a single garage is four (4). Trying to fill a garage past this limit 
 results in vehicles being deleted until only four are left.

Clearance (garages) - How high the roof is. Necessary to consider for larger 
 vehicles. Large clearance allows any vehicles, whereas medium clearance 
 denies entry to large vehicles, such as trucks like the Yankee and Mule, and 
 most notably, the Rhino.

Common Knowledge (credit) - This is a well-known special vehicle from long 
 before I wrote this guide, and as such, it is impossible to know to whom to 
 attribute its discovery.

Confirm - To "confirm" a car is to open and close the door of a garage 
 where you stored a vehicle obtained during a mission. As garages only 
 repair vehicles outside of missions, if you stick it in a garage mid-
 mission, save, and then re-load, the car won't be there. Confirming is 
 essential to keep vehicles obtained DURING missions, otherwise, expect 
 to lose your spoils.

Description - A description of unique color/feature vehicles and why they are 
 unique. Usually involves a unique color scheme or features that do not 
 normally occur on the vehicle.

Formulated by - This is who informed me of the strategy to obtain the vehicle. 
 Vehicles that were pointed out to me, but where I was given no strategy to 
 obtain it often lead to me developing the strategy, although most will have 
 the same entry for Discovered and Formulated by.

 NOTE: Vehicles that are given to you or are made very obviously available are 
 not given strategy credit, primarily because they are too simple to even call 
 a strategy. "Get inside and drive to a parking spot" really isn't deserving 
 of credit.

Heavy - A heavy vehicle has exaggerated handling (it feels "heavier"), and 
 also maintains the very unique property of being unstoppable and immovable, 
 in that it will effortlessly push other vehicles around, and be resistant 
 to the same from other vehicles. Doing that, however, rapidly destroys the 
 car as heavy does NOT shield it from damage. This property will not be 
 preserved by garages, and thus cannot be saved.

Jack - Slang term for stealing a car. Given that the game's name does involve 
 the crime of vehicle theft, it is a commonly used term in the guide. The vast 
 majority of vehicles that will be used during the game will be stolen or used 
 without explicit permission of the owner.

Manual aim weapon - Any gun that can be manually aimed. This includes the 
 AK-47, M4, both sniper rifles, and the M60 heavy machinegun.

Palette - The normal selection of colors the vehicle has. Random spawns and 
 Pay n' Sprays draw from a car's palette for colors when generated. Cars with 
 a special color are special because the color is not normally found in that 
 vehicle's palette.

Physical limit (garages) - How many vehicles can actually be squeezed in. 
 Motorcycles can almost always be squeezed in to hit the absolute limit of 4 
 vehicles.

Reliability (garages) - How reliable it is. Low reliability results in cars 
 often getting eaten, or losing their property. This can be for a variety of 
 reasons, but often is a result of being too close to a road, and thus prone 
 to accidentally opening as you drive by.

Super - A powered-up version of a vehicle. A super vehicle has higher 
 acceleration, top speed, turning, and traction than the normal version. This 
 property will not be preserved by garages, and thus cannot be saved.

Technical limit (garages) - This is the number of vehicles that can be stored 
 in a garage before the game refuses to open the door for new vehicles. This 
 limit is four (4) vehicles for any garage.

Unique - This vehicle has a unique name displayed and is found in story 
 missions only, or other limited availability missions, and thus can be 
 permanently missed on a playthrough if not obtained when the chance is 
 available.

Unlocked - Denotes a vehicle that is only infinitely available either 
 through story missions and/or by unlocking it at some point through the 
 story, whether by completing a mission, finishing a side mission, or even a 
 vehicle that is only available during a side mission, but is repeatedly 
 available by doing the mission over and over at your leisure. These vehicles 
 cannot be missed permanently.

Unobtainable - A vehicle that cannot be either obtained or permanently stored 
 for various reasons. This may be a result of being unable to ever drive or 
 even approach the vehicle (due to cutscenes or locked doors) or because it 
 will lose its special property(ies) if stored in a garage.





==============================================================================
*2* GARAGES
==============================================================================
Knowing your garages is essential, as they store your vehicles. Learn them, 
and it will serve you invaluably. The first number is the technical limit, 
and the number in parenthesis is the physical limit. The physical limit is 
assuming a small- to mid-sized car, such as the Blista Compact, or Admiral. 
If you're looking to store motorcycles, the physical limit is likely double, 
or even triple, the listed limit.

The absolute limit of all garages is four (4). Do not attempt to fill a 
garage past this number, or you WILL lose vehicles from the garage.

OCEAN BEACH SAFEHOUSE: 
~1 (1) space, high clearance, very reliable. (x1)

LEAF LINKS CONDO:
~1 (1) space, medium clearance, very reliable. (x1)

CASA DE LOCO:
~1 (1) space, medium clearance, very reliable. (x1)

VERCETTI ESTATE:
~2 (3) spaces, medium clearance, pretty reliable. (x1)

HYMAN CONDOS:
~2 (5) spaces, high clearance, incredibly unreliable. (x1)
~2 (2) spaces, high clearance, reliable. (x2)
NOTE: Putting more than one vehicle in the large garage can often cause them 
to be eaten, and often affects the other two garages' contents. In the worst 
cases, it can even affect ANY garage in the game, so don't use it unless 
necessary! If you must, putting only one vehicle in usually doesn't cause 
problems.

SUNSHINE AUTOS:
~2 (4) spaces, high clearance, very reliable. (x4)





==============================================================================
*3* PROOFED VEHICLES
==============================================================================
These vehicles all have a special proofing, granting them immunity from one or 
more forms of damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 - AP SC[White] Admiral
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: In the beginning (Start of the game)
Difficulty: ***
Mission failure? No
Required: !!!CHEATS!!!
Discovered by: 4emp2008

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A bright, white Admiral. This color is different from the normal 
duller white in the regular palette. It is also AP, providing protection 
against all hazards except rolling over, contact with the Rhino, stinger 
strips, and water.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: At the end of the cutscene with Ken parking near his office, 
activate the "Blow up all vehicles" cheat (R2, L2, R1, L1, L2, R2, Square, 
Triangle, Circle, Triangle, L2, L1). If done correctly, the Admiral will blow 
up, but Tommy will be unharmed. Now, the hard part: earning the money to buy a 
safehouse with a garage!

Spawn a Rhino (Circle, Circle, L1, Circle, Circle, Circle, L1, L2, R1, 
Triangle, Circle, Triangle), get inside and activate Vigilante, then exit and 
move away. Use the Blow up all cars cheat again to destroy the targets (and 
the Rhino). Spawn a new Rhino, get inside to advance to the next Vigilante 
level, and repeat. After level 7, you will have enough to afford the Links 
View Condo.

Spawn one last Rhino, then push the destroyed carcass of the Admiral towards 
the Links View safehouse. Once there, push it up against the purchase icon. 
Stand atop the wreckage and purchase the property. With luck, the car should 
remain there through the purchase cutscene. Now, simply push it to the nearby 
garage and inside. Once repaired, it should be AP and retain the unique white 
color of Ken's Admiral!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 - AP SC[Silver] Admiral
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Guardian Angels (Juan Garcia Cortez)
Difficulty: *
Mission failure? No (YES for Xbox version)
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A silver Admiral. more gray than the normal silver random color. 
It is also AP, providing protection against all hazards except rolling over, 
contact with the Rhino, stinger strips, and water.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Simply complete the mission. After it ends, head to the intersection 
just south of where you end the mission, and then turn east. The Admiral 
should be waiting there at the intersection, AP and with unlocked doors. Stick 
it in a garage immediately, as this is without a doubt the BEST vehicle in the 
game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: I've heard reports that this car vanishes after the final cutscene on 
the Xbox version, thus requiring you to fail the mission to obtain it on that 
version. Supposedly parking a car in front of it beforehand allows you to 
still obtain it without failure.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 - BP/FP/EP Squalo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Supply & Demand (Ricardo Diaz)
Difficulty: ***
Mission failure? YES
Discovered by: GTA_Loco

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Kill Lance after the race starts to fail the mission, then beach the 
boat and push it to a garage. Try for a spot near Hyman Condos, near the 
Stadium, and push it into the big garage at the condo. The difficulty is 
solely in the push from the beach to the garage, and that's not really 
difficult, just tedious. Be careful using the big garage, though, as it can 
sometimes lose vehicles (due to proximity to the street, and tendency to open 
anytime you drive nearby), and in particularly bad cases, can even cause 
vehicles in other garages to vanish.

<<Formulated by: GTA_Loco>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This Squalo is also DP, but the DP property does not function for boats, 
so it will accumulate collision damage as normal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 - FP/EP Squalo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Supply & Demand (Ricardo Diaz)
Difficulty: ***
Mission failure? YES
Discovered by: Grandtheftwiki.com

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: To obtain this version of the Squalo, kill Lance after reaching the 
deal, while he and Tommy are fighting their way back to Diaz's mansion. Beach 
the boat near Hyman Condos (by the Stadium), and push it into the big garage 
there. The difficulty is solely in the push from the beach to the garage, and 
that's not really difficult, just tedious. Be careful using the big garage, 
though, as it can sometimes lose vehicles (due to proximity to the street, and 
tendency to open anytime you drive nearby), and in particularly bad cases, can 
even cause vehicles in other garages to vanish.

<<Formulated by: GTA_Loco>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This Squalo is also DP, but the DP property does not function for boats, 
so it will accumulate collision damage as normal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5 - BP/FP/EP PCJ-600
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Bar Brawl (Tommy Vercetti)
Difficulty: *****
Mission failure? No
Required: Rhino tank (save it at Vercetti Estate)
Discovered by: Unknown

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Will write a strategy later, but in the meantime here is a video 
showing the trick:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pRLE81geSE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6 - BP/FP/EP Sabre Turbo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: The Driver (Malibu asset)
Difficulty: ****
Mission failure? YES
Required: Adrenaline pill, sniper rifle; Rhino
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 1 (only for the original PS2 release version):
When the race begins, instead of racing, drive north until you reach the sharp 
left turn. Take the turn and head down that road until you're in front of 
the pizza shop. Get out, and at about 2:00 into the race, grab the adrenaline 
pill behind the building to the south and ready your rifle. When Hilary comes 
over the nearby bridge, snipe him out. You'll fail the mission for killing 
Hilary. Now, push the car to your garage. Or better yet, just push it until 
the door (normally locked) is open enough that you can get in, and then drive 
it to the garage. When Hilary falls out he'll leave the door open partway, 
but it is sometimes still too narrow to actually get inside.

<<Formulated by: Common knowledge>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 2 (for later versions of the game):
Park a Rhino tank in the Vercetti Estate garage. After the race starts, head 
there, collecting a police bribe on the way. Fetch the Rhino and drive to the 
east side of the bridge mentioned in strategy 1 (near a Well Stacked Pizza), 
and wait. It takes around 1 minute and 50 seconds to get this far. Hilary will 
show up at around 2:10. When he does, make sure he doesn't drive around you. 
Hit his car with the tank to blow it up and fail. Then proceed to push it to 
a garage, taking care that it doesn't vanish.

<<Formulated by: MC>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: In the PC and Double Pack (Xbox) versions, this car apparently has no 
special proofings, making it a basic Sabre Turbo, like the one available at 
Sunshine Autos.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.7 - FP/EP Hotring Racer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Hot Ring (Hyman Stadium)
Difficulty: *****
Required: Lots of luck and tenacity
Discovered by: GTA_Loco (existence); Chester721 (how to obtain)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: This is the Hotring Racer provided for the race. Long thought to be 
unobtainable, an esoteric method of keeping it has been found! Two videos are 
provided below for your viewing pleasure, as it would be quite difficult to 
describe what to do accurately.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrlUAGIAgxA (done at the start of the game)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpIEncOYpE (done after achieving 100%)

Attempting this after 100% completion has the perk of vehicles having double 
their normal durability. As seen in the first video, the vehicle's health is 
dangerously low by the time he finally succeeds. So that this is not entirely 
reliant on the videos, I will provide a short write-up of the strategy used, 
although keep in mind I have not successfully acquired one myself.

When the race begins, begin driving and turn to the right, into the pitch 
black area in the wall. Continue turning until you're facing roughly 180 
degrees from how you started the race. Drive against the corner that your car 
will lodge against and keep going, turning to the right. Over the course of a 
couple of minutes, the car should begin turning on its side, with the wheels 
against the wall to the left.

Continue like this, accelerating and turning, and hopefully you will gradually 
turn the car until its vertical and beginning to go through the floor. Proceed 
and after a couple more minutes it will hopefully fall through the floor and 
flop to the ground.

When (and if) it falls through without being destroyed, hope that it lands on 
its wheels, as it could easily land on its roof, or bounce around and take 
enough damage to destroy it. Assuming it successfully lands, there is one last 
challenge to overcome. The world is black, dark, and without form. All is as 
it was when the world first coalesced into being. Cars and icons still spawn, 
though, giving a small sense of direction.

The goal now is to make it to the Downtown Ammu-Nation, to enter the rifle 
range and return color and shape to the world. When starting out, you will be 
behind the stadium, so begin feeling your way around the outside, using the 
parked cars as landmarks to determine progress. Work your way to the east as 
best as possible. The major landmark to look for is the police bribe in the 
alleyway with the Hyman Condo safehouse. From there, you'll want to exit the 
alley the way you entered (head west), then turn south once you feel you've 
reached the road. Head in that direction until you can see the icons at the 
hospital, then turn east once again. Feel around for the Ammu-Nation door, 
and look for the pink glow indicating the counter. Head to the right of it to 
enter the rifle range.

Once inside, color has returned! Exit the rifle range and return (on foot!) to 
the Hotring. It will be waiting behind the stadium. Carefully drive it to the 
garage at Hyman Condo, park it inside, and get out. Pull out a weapon and 
destroy the Hotring! The race will end due to your car being destroyed, and 
you will be teleported to the stadium entrance. Run back to the garage and if 
all went well, your shiny new FP/EP Hotring will be sitting inside, good as 
new! If it isn't... well, you'll have to try again.

3.8 - FP Infernus
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Sunshine Autos Street Races
Difficulty: ***
Required: Manual aim gun is recommended
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Start a race and then rush to the finish line. Wait for the other 
cars to finish. After the race is over, corner the car you desire. Take out an 
assault or sniper rifle, and snipe the driver. Afterwards, get in and drive to 
a garage. Just remember, the doors are locked, so don't get out until it's 
safely in a garage!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.9 - FP Cheetah
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mission: Sunshine Autos Street Races
Difficulty: ***
Required: Manual aim gun is recommended
Discovered by: Common knowledge

3.10 - FP Banshee
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Sunshine Autos Street Races

==============================================================================
*4* UNIQUE VEHICLES
==============================================================================
These vehicles only appear during story missions, and once the game is 
completed, cannot be acquired without cheating.

Always remember to confirm vehicles stored during a mission, whether you 
finished the mission successfully, or failed and need to retry it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 - Spand Express (1st of 2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Jury Fury (Ken Rosenberg)
Difficulty: *
Mission failure? No
Required: The Ocean Beach garage
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Attack the southern juror's car and he'll attempt to flee. Before 
getting far, he'll be blindsided by this Spand Express truck. Stick it in the 
Ocean Beach garage (the only one big enough), and confirm it after the 
mission. Make sure to buy that garage before attempting the mission! Complete 
R3 missions like Firefighter or Paramedic to easily earn the money needed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 - Spand Express (2nd of 2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Riot (Ken Rosenberg)
Difficulty: **
Mission failure? No
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Complete the mission up until you have to destroy the trucks. 
Destroy two of them, then take the last one to your Ocean Beach garage (the 
only one big enough). Once it is inside, destroy it and finish the mission. 
Let the garage close and open, and there's your truck! Make sure to buy that 
garage before attempting the mission! Complete R3 missions like Firefighter or 
Paramedic to easily earn the money needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 - Love Fist (1st of 2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Psycho Killer (Love Fist)
Difficulty: *
Mission failure? No
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Finish the mission normally and you'll be left with the Love Fist 
limo, assuming you used it and it survived the mission. Take it to a garage. 
Alternatively, you can drive straight to a garage, park it, blow it up, then 
let the garage close and open to repair it. This fails the mission, but is 
even easier.

<<Formulated by: Common knowledge>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: In the PC and Double Pack (Xbox) versions, the Love Fist spawns outside

merely rare (you unlock it) as opposed to unique.

4.4 - Love Fist (2nd of 2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Publicity Tour (Love Fist)
Difficulty: **
Mission failure? YES
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Complete the mission until the bomb is defused, then drive to a 
garage, destroy it (or snipe Love Fist) to fail the mission, and let the 
garage close then re-open.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: In the PC and Double Pack (Xbox) versions, the Love Fist spawns outside 
of the V-Rock station after completing their mission string, thus rendering it 
merely rare (you unlock it) as opposed to unique.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5 - Romero's Hearse
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Two Bit Hit (Avery Carrington)
Difficulty: **
Mission failure? No
Required: Sniper rifle and mission failure for strategy 2
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy preamble: These specific Romero's Hearses are NOT parked alongside 
the Well-Stacked Pizza. The one that is parked there is also FP. This hearse 
actually has a unique secondary color (black), but the Romero's Hearse doesn't 
use that secondary color in its model, so there's no way to see this in-game. 
Both are still unique, however, so take your pick (or fail the mission and 
obtain multiples).

Also, there are four variants of the hearse, each with a different setup in 
the back. There are three possible coffins (a blue coffin and two different 
style brown coffins) and one with no coffin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 1: To obtain both hearses and the black Voodoo, approach the funeral 
from the south, run up to the Voodoo, and get in. Drive to a garage (Sunshine 
Autos is a good location, but Hyman Condo works too), park the Voodoo inside, 
then return to the funeral. Jack the Romero's Hearse along the side of the 
road and take it to a garage as well. Return one last time and pursue the 
final hearse that started out parked next to the pizza shop (that is the FP 
hearse). It may have been driven off in the meantime, so chase it, corner it, 
and jack it. Return to the garages you stored the first two vehicles in to 
confirm them, then park the final hearse in a garage.

<<Formulated by: Militia>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 2: If the above strategy offers too much difficulty, or you want to 
collect multiple colors of coffin in the rear of the hearse, you can fail the 
mission by sniping the target from as far away as possible. The mission will 
fail because Tommy didn't make it clear the Cubans were behind the kill. At 
this point, run to the funeral and jack whichever vehicle you intend to keep. 
A good sniping spot is the road south of the funeral, just slightly north of 
the telephone pole on the west side of the street, south of the road to the 
junkyard.

This only allows obtaining one vehicle per attempt usually, as the game will 
delete the vehicles if you move too far from them, even if you don't use any 
other vehicles in-between. But this will allow an unlimited number of 
attempts at vehicles in the mission.

Mission: Two Bit Hit (Avery Carrington)
Difficulty: **
Mission failure? No
Required: Sniper rifle and mission failure for strategy 2
Discovered by: Grandtheftwiki.com

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy preamble: This fireproof Romero's Hearse is the one that is parked 
beside the Well Stacked Pizza store at the funeral. The other hearse has a 
special (but invisible) secondary color, but is NOT fireproof.

Also, there are four variants of the hearse, each with a different setup in 
the back. There are three possible coffins (a blue coffin and two different 
style brown coffins) and one with no coffin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================
*5* SPECIALLY COLORED/FEATURED VEHICLES
==============================================================================
These vehicles all have some special color or feature that the vehicle does 
not normally have. A detailed description of what makes them special will be 
contained within each entry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 - SC[White] Admiral
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: In the beginning (Start of the game)
Difficulty: *****
Mission failure? No
Required: Enough money to buy a safehouse with a garage
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A bright, white Admiral. This color is different from the normal 
dull white found in the regular palette.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 1: This is the car Ken drives in the opening scenes. It is tricky to 
keep, as you will have no garages, making storage a problem. A good idea is to 
go do the Paramedic missions while leaving this stored near the hospital. Vice 
City's engine keeps the last two vehicles you used in memory, so long as the 
door remains open. So, get out of your Admiral, leaving the door open, and do 
the Paramedic missions. If you lose the Ambulance though, be careful, as you 
cannot take any other vehicle, lest your Admiral be deleted.

<<Formulated by: Common knowledge>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 2: Park the Admiral behind the Well Stacked Pizza north of the police 
station in the middle of the island. Complete the pizza missions for extra 
money (usually around $5500), and use it to buy the safehouse. The pizza 
missions are quicker and easier than Paramedic, and the bike used has radio. 
If it doesn't earn enough money, it should put you close to the needed amount. 
Remember, if you lose your vehicle, start a new game, as it may be difficult 
to amass the money needed without losing the Admiral.

<<Formulated by: Christopher Fuentes>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 3: If the above strategies don't pan out, do whatever else you can 
for money; robbing stores can be a good alternative, so long as you mind the 
wanted level. Messing this up can be bothersome, but unless you almost have 
enough for the safehouse, another try is just a new game away.

<<Formulated by: Common knowledge>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: On the PC version, this Admiral apparently spawns outside of the 
Vercetti Mansion after completing the mission "Keep Your Friends Close," thus 
rendering it merely rare (you unlock it) as opposed to unique. This has also 
been confirmed for the Xbox Double Pack version.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2 - SC[Black] Washington
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: All Hands on Deck! (Juan Garcia Cortez)
Difficulty: *****
Mission failure? No
Required: Mission failure for a MUCH easier method
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: This is a solid black Washington. This color can be produced 
via the Black Traffic cheat, too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 1 (no failure): Upon starting the mission, jump down to the lowest 
level of the boat (in the back). Various enemy boats should be nearby, 
including a Speeder. Pull out a rifle (assault or sniper) and take out the 
driver. Most of the time, the boat should turn towards you; if so, press the 
vehicle enter button to get in. Once driving the Speeder, head back to the 
docks with the black Washingtons. DO NOT get inside one, otherwise the mission 
will fail.

Begin pushing the Washington to the Ocean Beach garage using only Tommy's 
body. This is a long, arduous push, and sometimes the Washingtons may become 
too "heavy" to push. Taking too long also triggers a cutscene, so act with as 
much haste as possible. Once the Washington is inside the garage, return to 
your boat and complete the mission. Afterwards, return to the garage to 
confirm the vehicle. Just be sure NOT to get inside any other vehicle on your 
way back to the garage, or else the Washington will vanish!

<<Formulated by: 4emp2008>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 2 (with failure): Follow strategy 1, but instead of pushing to the 
Ocean Beach garage, push a Washington close to where Cortez's mission marker 
was (the southern-most marina gate). Get inside the Washington and the mission 
will fail. The Washington should still be there after the cutscene, as it was 
close enough to where Tommy ends up after the mission ends.

<<Formulated by: MC>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Apparently, in the Xbox Double Pack version of his game, the Washingtons 
in this mission are white, not black. The white is the same color as ones 
found on the street, so they are no longer unique.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3 - SC[Silver] PCJ-600
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Autocide (Assassination contract)
Difficulty: *
Mission failure? No
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A bright silver PCJ-600. This is a very unique color for the 
bike.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Simply start the mission and go to the weapon drop point. This 
PCJ-600 is just sitting there for you. Complete the mission and store it. If 
you're going for other vehicles in this mission, stick it in a garage and 
proceed to get the other vehicles, confirming it afterwards.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.4 - SC[Black/Purple] Bobcat
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Autocide (Assassination contract)
Difficulty: **
Mission failure? No
Required: Manual aim weapon (preferably a sniper rifle)
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: This is a solid black Bobcat with metallic purple-red panels 
along the side. It is a nice looking combo that cannot be reproduced with the 
Black Traffic cheat, due to the color of the sides.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Complete the mission up until you get to the two people in the 
Bobcat, then snipe the driver. The passenger will rush you with a shotgun, so 
kill him off quickly. Get in the Bobcat, and store it in a garage. Be careful 
not to get too close though, as the doors are locked. If they speed off, the 
only option is to corner them and snipe the driver - not an easy task. Once 
the mission is over, go confirm the truck, and gaze at its pretty purple side 
panel.

Mission: Autocide (Assassination contract)
Difficulty: *
Mission failure? No
Required: Nothing
Discovered by: Grandtheftwiki.com

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Although PCJ-600s come in two different blue colors already, this 
one is a third, unique shade of blue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: The final target of this mission drives this motorcycle. After 
killing him, simply claim his motorcycle as your trophy and drive it to a 
garage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.6 - SC[Black] Admiral (1st of 2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Check Out at the Check In (Assassination contract)
Difficulty: ***
Mission failure? No
Required: Flamethrower or molotovs
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: This is a solid black Admiral. A sturdy, reliable vehicle for any 
purpose except extreme speed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Complete the mission up until the point you must escape the airport 
and drop the package off at Ammu-Nation. At this point, several black Admirals 
will chase you, with gunners mounted on the roof. Get to a safe location, and 
take out the gunner of the target vehicle, then set fire to the car. The 
driver will get out and run off, leaving the normally locked door open. Get 
in, drive to a garage (preferably the close Sunshine Auto garage, if you own 
it), then grab another vehicle and complete the mission. Confirm the car, and 
it's yours!

<<Formulated by: Common knowledge>>

NOTE: This vehicle can also be produced via the "Black Traffic" cheat, leaving 
a last resort for someone who absolutely needs this vehicle and has nothing 
left to lose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.7 - SC[White] Walton
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Gun Runner (Phil Cassidy)
Difficulty: ***
Mission failure? No
Required: Manual aim weapon
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A plain white Walton. Looks quite simple (and it is), but special 
nonetheless.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Simply snipe the driver of one of the white Waltons, then store it 
in a garage. After collecting all weapons, and destroying all other trucks, 
destroy this in the garage, then let it close and open, and voila, your very 
own white Walton! Be careful, because if you do too much damage to the gun 
runners before taking a truck, they call in continual reinforcements with 
SMGs on Faggios. This will make it very difficult to get into the Walton and 
make it to a garage intact.

5.8 - SC[Gold] Stretch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Martha's Mug Shot (Film Studio asset)
Difficulty: *
Mission failure? No
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A golden-colored Stretch limo. Very nice looking and classy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 1: Follow the Stretch to its destination, then check the road south 
of the Malibu. The Stretch should be sitting there, empty and waiting. Take it 
to a garage, then finish the mission and confirm it afterwards. Alternatively, 

park it somewhere safe, take the pictures, then get in a car and lose the 
wanted level. Go back and get the Stretch afterwards. Be sure to only get in
a single car after the Stretch, otherwise it will disappear!

<<Formulated by: Common knowledge>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 2: While still at the Film Studio, snipe the driver, waste all 12 
shots of the camera to fail the mission, then drive it to a garage. This 
avoids the hassle of dealing with a wanted level later on, or having to 
confirm it.

5.9 - SC[Black] Sentinel
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Hit the Courier (Print Works asset)
Difficulty: ***
Mission failure? No
Required: Manual aim weapon
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: This is a solid black Sentinel. A reasonable four-door sedan with 
decent top speed and average handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: First, take a car to the Print Works before the mission. Then, 
after starting the mission, quickly drive to the drop site and dispose of the 
sentries. Don't worry if you get a star or two. Once everyone is dead, stand 
in front of the black Sentinel (I stood on the loading ramp to the west) and 
ready a sniper or assault rifle, aiming at the driver's seat. Once she gets 
in, fire. Once she's dead, stay away, because the car accelerates anyways! 
After a couple of seconds, it stops and she falls out dead, along with the 
plates. Grab them, and get in. Be careful; the doors lock, so if you are not 
going to stay inside the car (due to the wanted level), leave the door open!

From there are two options. If you have just one star (or none), just drive 
directly to the end of the mission. Get out (keeping the door open), finish, 
then drive to a garage. If you have two or more stars, the alternative is to 
get back out immediately, find another car, then use it to lose your wanted 
level. Return to the Sentinel and finish the mission. Be sure to ONLY get 
inside a single other car, or else the Sentinel will vanish!

5.10 - SC[Black] Pony
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Loose Ends (Assassination Contract)
Difficulty: *****
Mission failure? No
Required: Two (2) Packer trucks
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: This is a solid black Pony. A traditional GTA van, the Pony's 
performance is what one expects from a van: slow acceleration, mediocre top 
speed, and average handling with a slight tendency to tip.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: This can be difficult. First, kill off everyone in the area, making 
sure NOT to destroy (or even get into) the Admirals or Pony. Once everyone is 
gone, drive to Viceport and grab the Packer parked there. To reach it, drive 
straight south on the road that runs by Sunshine Autos until it reaches a 
point where it turns left as the only route available. The Packer should be 
waiting there in the dirt lot to the left (before the turn).

Drive it back, and position it perpendicular to the gate. Run (do NOT drive) 
back to Viceport and jack a second Packer, then drive it back to the first 
one. Drive it up the first Packer, and over the gate. Then, position it 
perpendicular to the gate, and simply drive the Pony up the Packer, over the 
gate, and then to a nearby garage. Don't forget to confirm this after the 
mission, as with the level of work required, it's both easy and incredibly 
annoying to forget.

Description: This is a solid black Admiral. A sturdy, reliable vehicle for any 
purpose except extreme speed.

strategy works for this Admiral, although it's easier to get one from the 
previous assassination contract.

5.12 - SC[Bright blue] Maverick
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Loose Ends (Assassination contract)
Difficulty: *
Mission failure? No
Discovered by: Grandtheftwiki.com

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: The blue color of this Maverick is different from others. It is 
the same blue on the final target's PCJ-600 from the Autocide contract.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: This is found on top of the Cherry Poppers roof near the end of 
the mission. To keep it, just get inside and finish the mission using it. 
After the mission has ended, carefully navigate it inside the large garage at 
the Hyman Condo safehouse, since that is the only place large enough to 
effectively store this. Also, don't forget to confirm the black Pony and/or 
Admiral, if either was also obtained during the mission!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.13 - SC[Black] Voodoo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Two Bit Hit (Avery Carrington)
Difficulty: **
Mission failure? No
Required: Sniper rifle and mission failure for strategy 2
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: This is a solid black Voodoo. The typical Haitian gang car has a 
nice makeover, but its performance is otherwise identical to the red version 
often seen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 1: To obtain both hearses and the black Voodoo, approach the funeral 
from the south, run up to the Voodoo, and get in. Drive to a garage (Sunshine 
Autos is a good location, but Hyman Condo works too), park the Voodoo inside, 
then return to the funeral. Jack the Romero's Hearse along the side of the 
road and take it to a garage as well. Return one last time and pursue the 
final hearse that started out parked next to the pizza shop (that is the FP 
hearse). It may have been driven off in the meantime, so chase it, corner it, 
and jack it. Return to the garages you stored the first two vehicles in to 
confirm them, then park the final hearse in a garage.

<<Formulated by: Militia>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRATEGY 2: If the above strategy offers too much difficulty, or you want to 
collect multiple colors of coffin in the rear of the hearse, you can fail the 
mission by sniping the target from as far away as possible. The mission will 
fail because Tommy didn't make it clear the Cubans were behind the kill. At 
this point, run to the funeral and jack whichever vehicle you intend to keep. 

Two vehicles can be kept this way by getting inside one, then getting back out 
and taking a different vehicle to a garage. Afterwards, run back to the site 
on foot (don't get in any other vehicle!) and the original vehicle should 
still be sitting there.

Mission: In the beginning (Start of the game)
Discovered by: GTA_Loco

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A solid black Maverick helicopter, without the usual white/color 
pattern they usually have. Apparently it uses a unique Maverick model as well, 
but it matters little due to the fact that...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: ...it exists only in the opening cutscene.

6.2 - Heavy Admiral
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Jury Fury (Ken Rosenberg)
Discovered by: Andreaz1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: After starting the mission, proceed to the south juror's location. 
Using a melee weapon, bang up his car, damaging it cosmetically as much as 
possible. Once it starts smoking lightly, attack the juror and he will get 
inside, then immediately get back out and run off. The car is now heavy. If 
you get the cutscene where he hits the Spand Express truck, the car loses the 
property though!

<<Formulated by: Andreaz1>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: The heavy property is removed by garages, so storage is not 
possible. The property is also removed when the mission ends, pass or fail.

Mission: Jury Fury (Ken Rosenberg)

Unobtainable: It is locked at the start of the mission, and loses the heavy 
property after the cutscene with the north juror. It also loses the property 
after the mission is over (pass or fail), or when stored in a garage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A solid black Stretch. This vehicle can also be acquired via the 
Black Traffic cheat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: It exists only in cutscenes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.9 - SC[Black] Stretch (2nd of 3)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Demolition Man (Avery Carrington)
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A solid black Stretch. This vehicle can also be acquired via the 
Black Traffic cheat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: It exists only in cutscenes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.10 - Oceanic w/ briefcases in the back
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Bar Brawl (Tommy Vercetti)
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: An Oceanic with some briefcases sitting in the trunk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: It is just sitting there for the taking. Help yourself to it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: The briefcases disappear after the mission is over, success or 
failure. Even destroying the car beforehand doesn't prevent the briefcases 
from vanishing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.11 - Heavy Securicar
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Autocide (Assassination Contract)
Discovered by: Andreaz1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: This Securicar houses the second target in this mission. Snipe him 
out from the opposing roof (where you were stationed in Guardian Angels), then 
get in and go for a joyride.

<<Formulated by: Andreaz1>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: The heavy property is removed by garages, so storage is not 
possible. The property is also removed when the mission ends, pass or fail.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.12 - Taxi w/ open trunk
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: The Job (Malibu asset)
Discovered by: Lancet Jades

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A Taxi in perfect condition with an open trunk. Usually, for the 
trunk to be open, it must have taken some damage to knock it open.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: This is the Taxi used in the mission. Snipe Hilary to fail the 
mission and obtain it yourself, but the doors are locked, so be careful.

<<Formulated by: Lancet Jades>>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: Storing it in a garage or even using a Pay n' Spray "repairs" 
the trunk, correcting the only thing that makes this Taxi special.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.13 - SC[Gold] Stretch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Recruitment Drive (Film Studio asset)
Discovered by: GTA_Loco

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A golden-colored Stretch limo. Looks nice and classy, perfect for 
porn stars and governors alike.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: It disappears after the cutscene. You can use the Destroy All 
Cars cheat to blow it up, but the game stays in the cutscene forever if you 
do. Just get the one from Martha's Mug Shot.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.14 - Super Angel
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Alloy Wheels of Steel (Mitch Baker)
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: Jack the bike of one of the opponent bikers (easiest if one falls 
off), then end the race and store it in a garage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: The super property is removed by garages, so all that will 
remain is an unremarkable, non-special Angel bike.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.15 - SC[Black Stretch] (3rd of 3)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Two Bit Hit (Avery Carrington)
Discovered by: Common knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: A solid black Stretch. This vehicle can also be acquired via the 
Black Traffic cheat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: It exists only in cutscenes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.16 - BP/FP/EP Sanchez
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission: Dirt Ring (Hyman Stadium)
Discovered by: GTA_Loco

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY: This is the Sanchez provided for the obstacle course. It can only be 
used during the course. Interestingly, the bike is also flagged as DP, but 
that property has no effect on motorcycles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unobtainable: You cannot get it out of the Dirt Ring arena. Apparently there 
IS a way to get it on the PC version, however I do not have any idea how it is 
done.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------





==============================================================================
*7* RARE VEHICLES
==============================================================================
These vehicles aren't anything inherently special and limited to missions, but 
nonetheless have some unique quality worth noting. These often require some 
action to "unlock" them to be available, such as completion of a mission or 
side mission to unlock. The defining trait of this class of special vehicle is 
that they can all be obtained at the end of the game without any problem, but 
NOT the beginning.

Always remember to confirm vehicles stored during a mission, whether you 
finished the mission successfully, or failed and need to retry it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Missions the vehicle may also be found in:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlocked (1): Collect 90 Hidden Packages.
Found (1): Spawns in the Air Force Base.

Unlocked (2): Complete Sir, Yes Sir! to unlock 6-star wanted levels.
Found (2): Jack a tank during a 6-star wanted level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missions the car may also be found in:
Sir, Yes Sir!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This vehicle is BP/EP by design. I have heard reports that enough 
bullets or explosions may destroy it, however that should not be possible. It 
is not FP or DP, so fire and just regular knocking around still damage it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.12 - Hunter
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlocked (1): Collect all 100 Hidden Packages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missions the car may also be found in:
All Hands On Deck!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.13 - SC[Black] Sanchez
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlocked: Complete the Trial by Dirt course in Downtown once.

Found: On subsequent attempts, three Haitians wielding Machetes will attack 
you. Their Sanchezs are a special black color.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Later versions have a quirk for this. You MUST complete Test Track 
before Trial by Dirt (Landstakler before Sanchez), otherwise the latter will 
not register. Complete Test Track as slowly as possible, then Trial by Dirt 
even slower. Apparently Trial by Dirt will never register as any better than 
Test Track's score, so be careful. Eventually, besting your time repeatedly 
(you get paid for beating the time, hence the long first tries) should yield 
the events with these vehicles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.14 - SC[Black] Rancher
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlocked: Complete the Test Track course in Downtown three times (each attempt  
requires a better time than the last to count).

Found: On the fourth attempt and beyond, a PIG in a black Rancher will assail 
you as you drive the course. Ram him until he gets out, then kill him, and 
take the Rancher for yourself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Later versions have a quirk for this. You MUST complete Test Track 
before Trial by Dirt (Landstakler before Sanchez), otherwise the latter will 
not register. Complete Test Track as slowly as possible, then Trial by Dirt 
even slower. Apparently Trial by Dirt will never register as any better than 
Test Track's score, so be careful. Eventually, besting your time repeatedly 
(you get paid for beating the time, hence the long first tries) should yield 
the events with these vehicles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.15 - Bloodring Banger
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlocked: Acquire more than 1 minute remaining in the Bloodring at Hyman 
Stadium.

Found: Parked outside the stadium. There are two models: one based on the 
Glendale, and one based on the Oceanic.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.16 - Glitched vehicles
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlocked: Available any time in free roam, unless vehicle has a specific 
unlock criteria.

Found: These can be found randomly in the game whenever the vehicle in 
question spawns. It is usually a result of too many other vehicles and 
pedestrians in the immediate area, causing the game to "forget" to load the 
missing feature. Once a vehicle loads with a feature missing, it will be 
permanent, and thus these can be saved in a garage to keep the featureless 
version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIST OF VEHICLES:
-Bloodring Banger (no number on roof)
-Cabbie (without light)
-Coach (no sign on side)
-Flatbed (no objects in bed)
-Kaufman Cab (without light)
-Taxi (without light)
-Zebra Cab (without light)

==============================================================================
*9* MISSION LIST
==============================================================================
Here is a breakdown of every mission in the game, and any special vehicles 
within. This is also the mission order that the previous sections follow, in 
terms of vehicle order. 

The following order is based on acquiring a "perfect" game. The reason Two Bit 
Hit is so late in the list is to prevent the Havana Clothes from glitching. 
Missions that force clothes on you are what cause it to glitch, in particular, 
Cop Land and The Job. I placed it so late just to ensure that there'd be 
minimal trouble given by the remaining missions. Not to mention leaving the 
Cuban/Haitian string of missions for so late in the game prevents the Haitians 
from bothering you too much.

*10* FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
==============================================================================
Q: My car disappeared from the garage!
A: Garages ARE known to eat vehicles. The safest way to avoid this is to save 
frequently over multiple slots, and regularly check garages. In particular, 
the Silver PCJ-600 seems to have a nasty tendency to vanish.

Q: My vehicle lost its property!
A: Occasionally, garages DO eat the special properties of vehicles, though it 
is rare. When checking to see if the vehicle actually exists, also test its 
proofing.

Q: You missed [insert special vehicle]!
A: Email me, and let me know. You will receive full credit for it.

Q: [Insert special vehicle] doesn't possess a property you said it did!
A: Most likely, you did not follow the precise strategy. If you did, and it 
does not retain its property, contact me and say so, although I personally 
check each and every vehicle.

Q: One of the vehicles you listed is one I discovered first, and here's proof! 
Thief!
A: I attribute vehicles I knew about before writing this to "common 
knowledge." If you discovered a vehicle, and/or developed a strategy, and you 
have proof of it (a link to an old forum post somewhere, or possibly an FAQ 
that credits you), tell me, and I'll give you full credit. Although I wish I 
could give the proper credit for most vehicles, the need for a consolidated 
special vehicle guide for VC takes priority over tracking down each and every 
person beforehand.

just pointing out a spelling or grammatical mistake, please do so, no matter 
how small. Keep in mind though that I live in the U.S., and as such, I use

4emp2008
~Discovered and created the strategy for the CP white Admiral at the beginning 
 of the game, and a cheatless fail-less strategy for the black Washington.

Andreaz1
~Discovered the heavy Admiral in Jury Fury and Securicar in Autocide! Also 
 added a note about the white Admiral on PC version, and mentioned a heavy 
 Sentinel in Jury Fury. Also found a silver Stretch in the final mission 
 (very subtle difference from the normal color).

Chester721
~Discovered the method of obtaining the FP/EP Hotring Racer! Amazing work.

Christopher Fuentes
~Provided an easier strategy for the White Admiral and cars in Two Bit Hit.

Common Knowledge
~Findings labeled "common knowledge" are labeled so because they have been so 
 widely known and distributed that it is impossible for me to obtain the true 
 source that found it (I know for a fact that I have read the info on 
 numerous sites, and little of it came from gamefaqs). I do not take or 
 deserve any credit for these vehicles, as I am NOT the person who discovered 
 them, nor the strategies (though I have improved/elaborated on/fixed some of 
 them). If you are the person who found a vehicle and/or developed a strategy 
 for obtaining it, email me with a link to a source that credits you for 
 finding it (such as another FAQ), and I will gladly give you credit. Again,

general format to better match my later guides.

Edited and fixed more minor things. Small typos and such. Oh, also moved the

the way multiple unlocked and found methods are organized in the Rare 
section, to bring into line with a standardized format across all my guides. 
Also reversed the order of the Mission List and Breakdown by Quality lists, 
because having the missions first caused me more annoyance than you would 
ever believe possible.

2.85     Completed January 4th, 2011.
Added a note on Ken's white Admiral, a heavy Sentinel to the unobtainable 
list, and a note on the black Rancher. Also rewrote some strategies to better 
describe how they work. Figured out a MUCH better strategy for the black 
Voodoo and Romero's Hearse in Two Bit Hit (getting both without having to 
die or get busted, or deal with a difficult strategy). And finally, Andreaz1 
also found a unique silver Stretch in the final mission!

Christopher Fuentes.

Changed my contact information.

2.88     Completed October 21st, 2011.
Someone confirmed seeing a lightless Zebra Taxi. Enough for me to put it in 
the normal vehicle sections, since it's pretty much a guarantee at this 
point anyways. Completely removed the "suspected vehicles" section due to 
this, as I doubt it will ever have a purpose again.

2.89     Completed June 25th, 2012.
Made a couple small spelling fixes, and updated the whitelist to mention the 
latest version is always found on GameFAQs.com.

Changed the spacing of the sections in the guide, and updated contact info.

Added some notes about later-version vehicles, courtesy of Professional 
Amateur. Also improved the formatting of the vehicle sections of the guide.

2.92     Completed September 21st, 2012.
Added a note that the white Admiral is also found in front of Vercetti 
Mansion on the Xbox Double Pack version.

2.93     Completed November 28th, 2014.
Removed the CDP information regarding Cuban Hermes, since it is a standard 
feature on that vehicle. Added the FP/EP Squalo from Supply and Demand, since 
it is different from the BP/FP/EP version, and the CP white Admiral from the 
beginning (unfortunately requiring cheats). Added a few other vehicles that 
had been discovered as well.

2.94     Completed June 24th, 2016.
Nearly ten years, baby! thehambone93 reported to me (a couple of years ago, 
actually) that the gold Stretch in Martha's Mug Shot apparently is tricky to 
get on the Haitian Friendly PS2 greatest hits release. Clarified the method 
that works on that release.

2.95     Completed December 16th, 2016.
Updated a lot of the guide's formatting. Made mention that the CP Admiral in 
Guardian Angels is a unique color, updated Romero's Hearse strategy, added 
note about DP not affecting bikes/boats/helis. Removed silver Stretch from 
final mission as it is not special. A lot of these updates are thanks to 
Militia's guide on gtaforums.com! Also consolidated all glitched vehicles 
into one single entry in rare vehicles. Also info on a proofed PCJ in Bar 
Brawl and a way to obtain the FP/EP Hotring Racer.

2.96     Completed March 28th, 2018.
Altered mention of the comprehensiveproof property (CP) to all-proof (AP), 
updated the vehicle titles with new tags for special colors and properties, to 
better illuminate why and how they are special. Added a plug for SpriteFan274's 
guide for the game on GTAforums.com and also properly credited Chester721 for 
the discovery of how to get the FP/EP Hotring Racer!
