The purpose of this project is to provide as many Cheats/ Codes and Mods to Vice City PS2 as possible and ensure that any future play throughs have maximised potential of fun and ease of play.

I am too old to be doing hours of annoying missions and stupid shit.

My feelings on the matter:
* The game is 23+ years old at this point, yet barely 50% of what is possible has ever been don,  and still thousands of crappy youtube videos beign made with 50 x times that in veiws, just copy paste bullshit.
* The level of piracy within american users is abundantly clear, determined by the sheer lack of support for PAL versions, gated communities and crappy forums. The math just does not add up - you can;t all be owning the same product, it is impossible.

* This base version used is PAL 2003 , for that exact reason & more;-

This content is put together entirely by TKBS, there are no other projects like this for PAL 2003, nor GTAVC PS2 as a whole.

EVERY cheat, code and mod is produced by TKBS, from the ground up

Completely unique. Includes information and discoveries never been seen before.
