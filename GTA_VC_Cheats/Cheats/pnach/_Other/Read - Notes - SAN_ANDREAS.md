//INFO:			Cheat codes for GTA:SA (PS2) (PAL) (2004)
** This is all the notes, research, Unknown, broken, to do list etc that accompany the ".pnach" & ".ct" cheats.
** It may also include codes that work , but these present in the final file && are just an aid to the process that created them or the non-working stuf, which may help.

//Request:		Please Add, fix, or port any missing codes, devs can read the Notes & Junk for more info

//TODO LIST;-

//* 100% Complete - Unlocks ?? Hydra & Rhino outside CJ's
//* Clean Streets: No Peds & No Traffic - Port from NTSC 
//* Jump varying heights. - gravity but no jump height adjustments.
//* Clean Streets (NO peds, traffic)		- NOT DONE - UNKNOWN!
//* No Cops AI 			- PARTIAL
* teleport
* equip parachute, jetpack.



//---- In-Game Cheats Addresses. ----
//** THESE ARE FOR REFERENCE ONLY, it will not activate all th cheats, but it shows the memory region where the button inputs happening and booleans set.
//* Example: 	Clown Mode works as button combo, but not as just setting the 0 to 1.
//* 			Max Total Respect  Works as Both butto combo and just setting the byte value to 1.
//* many other things work like peds with guns, riot mode, etc. some do not.
//--- Transferring this knowledge from San Andreas to Vice City ----
//* Used to find cheats in PAL
//*  In San andreas type cheat code for weapons here is the input:
//*  			44440000 4452554C 3431344C 00000033 00000000
//* 			00 00 44 44 4C 55 52 44 4C 34 31 34 33 00 00 00
//*  search for that in PAL VICE CITY
//*  this part was found
//*  			.....................44 4C 34 31 34 33 00 00 00
//** PAL VICE CITY 2003 MEMORY REGION FOR IN GAME CHEATS = "205C18F7"

// -------------- Me fixing the CJ's Garage Cheats --------------
//--------------------------------------------------------------------

//* This is the stuff related to CJ's Garge. I noticed the PAL ARMAX CD codes were very strange compared to vice city.
//* NTSC Codes online are the same, they just look weird even though they work.
//* there was no VH 2 in the garage code on ARMAx, nor was there ddamage proof, nor was their a colour setter.
//* So i corrected the PAL RMAX CD codes, and the pnach codes, and the ntsc codes, and added damage proof and colours based on mmy knowledge from Vice City.
//* I still have no idea why the others codes used these weirrd har daddress 0x, 1x. It makes more sense to use the corrected versions i posted.

The Final Version looks like this:
//Vehicles: CJ's Garage:  ----			FINAL VERSION: IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE.		- by TKBS
//Line 1 = 	VH ID & DMG PROOF
//Line 2 = 	Colours		||				e.g - 0000|01|7E = Pink with White Stripes, See colors.dat.
//patch=1,EE,2080D9E0,extended,01A4001F
//patch=1,EE,2080DA02,extended,0000557E

Here is how i did it:

// [KEY] ---- Vehicles ---- Vehicles List: (use vehicles.ide)
//IDs: 400-611 || Hex: 190 - 263
//Mr Whoopee 	= 423	|| 000001A7
//BRAVURA 		= 401	|| 00000191
//Cop Car LA	= 596   || 00000254
//Fire-Truck	= 407   || 00000197
//Rhino-Tank	= 432   || 000001B0

// Old Notes:
//* I have No idea how or why this works, what the color address is, or why i cannot find garages like vice city.
//* Vehicle must exist in garage, maing it a bit pointless, other than dmg proof.

//CJ's Garage:
//Line 1 default = ???????? || - literally all ?'s  -Also - the first line doesn't even do anything (?).
//Line 2 default = 0D88D0DD || - My guess at damage proof, based on VC - this line does not exist on ARMax CD.
//Line 3 default = DDDD0D88 || - Vehicle ID 2?
//Line 4 default = DDDD0D88 || - My guess at Vehicle ID 1?
//Line 5 ?????????????????? || - My guess at colour ? - In vice city, Colour is +20 from VH id line.
//* i noticed the car change and not bike, the 4 bytes up crashed game, bytes before line 3 worked for VH 2

//[NTSC(2?) D080E472] - [PAL(black) D080D9E2] = A90 | (2,704)
//Possibly Add "1" or "2C" or "4 bytes" to one of the digits (the 8 or D?) for the next garage.
//TODO: TEST: 0000FFFF
